== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I obtain a license for Haystack? =

Got to [Haystack.menu](https://haystack.menu/) and follow the simple steps in order to create your account and receive access.

= Are there ways to override the content sent up to the server? Such as images or content so that I can make my searches more customizable? =

Haystack has built in filters that allow you to change some defined variables that represent your web page. Currently the filters `haystack_set_type`, `haystack_set_image`, `haystack_set_body`, and `haystack_set_tags` have been enabled. These functions are passed the ID of the post, and the returned data will be sent to elasticsearch. 

Here are two examples set in a user's theme folder in their functions.php file:

	//We want type here to show much more data than the average
	function _haystack_set_type($id) {
	  //Adding post type as the first of the tags to pass
	  $post_type = get_post_type($id);
	  $post_type = get_post_type_object($post_type);
	  $tags[] = array($post_type->labels->singular_name);

	  //Adding the post author as the second part of the tags array to pass
	  $post_auth = get_post($id);
	  $post_auth = $post_auth->post_author;
	  $tags[] = get_the_author_meta('nicename',$post_auth);
	  
	  //Adding categories to the array
	  $post_cat = wp_get_post_categories($id);
	  foreach ($post_cat as $c) {
	    $cat = get_category($c);
	    $tags[] = $cat->name;
	  }

	  //Adding tags associated with the post, if they exist
	  $post_tags = wp_get_post_tags($id);
	  foreach ($post_tags as $key => $val) {
	    $tags[] = $val->name;
	  }

	  //Return in <cat> tags
	  return (!empty($tags) ? '<cat>'.implode('</cat><cat>',$tags).'</cat>' : '');
	}
	//Apply the filter
	add_filter('haystack_set_type','_haystack_set_type');

The second example here hooks in and replaces all images with a static one:

	//Add a sample image to each Haystack post item. Image could alternately be fetched from the ID
	function _haystack_set_image($id) {
	  return 'http://www.gallaghersmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gallagher.jpg';
	}
	//Apply the filter
	add_filter('haystack_set_image','_haystack_set_image');
